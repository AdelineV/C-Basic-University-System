# CPP-Basic-University-System
This project is one of my final assignments for Object Oriented Programming C++ course. I have programmed a basic university system, utilizing concepts such as 
classes and object, multiple inheritance, polymorphism.

There are 7 classes, namely Password, Courses, Profile, Enrol, Student, Lecturer and Administrator.

There are 3 roles: Administrator, Lecturer and Student.

Administrators can display their own information, enrol students and change their password.
Lecturers can display their own information, view courses assigned for them and change their password.
Students can display their own information, view courses enrolled and change their password.

1. Courses are assigned to students and lecturers according to the faculties they are in when lecturers create a new account and administrators enrol the student.
2. All roles have to key in the correct ID and password in order to login to their accounts.
